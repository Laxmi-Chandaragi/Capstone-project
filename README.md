# Problem Statement
Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, wants to increase its annual memberships, which generate more stable, long-term revenue compared to casual riders.
However, the company currently lacks a clear understanding of how casual riders and annual members differ in their riding behaviors.
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can this insight help convert more casual riders into annual members?
